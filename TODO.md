1. Add typehints everywhere --Done
2. make all functions in skeleton stabilize take inputs and outputs of pytorch 
   (hide PIL, cv2, np as much as possible) -- Done
3. generate onehot from int-images -- Done
4. make all functions pytorch, [BxCxHxW] ,[0.-1.] --Done
5. write a radial_skeleton_stalization_method
6. write code that checks anisotropy or other skeleton stabillity questions.
7. extract_radial_skelton and binarization two distinct stages --Done
