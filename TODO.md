1. Add typehints everywhere
2. make all functions in skeleton stabilize take inputs and outputs of pytorch (hide PIL, cv2, np as much as possible)
3. generate onehot from int-images
4. make all functions pytorch, [BxCxHxW] ,[0.-1.]
5. write a radial_skeleton_stalization_method
6. write code that checks anisotropy or other skeleton stabillity questions.
7. extract_radial_skelton and binarization two distinct stages.
